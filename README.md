Analytical tools supporting ecosystem based management in south Florida


## What you have here

`EvergladesEBM` is an R package with analytical tools supporting ecosystem based management in south Florida.



## Installation

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("troyhill/EvergladesEBM", ref = "main")
```


## Usage

EvergladesEBM can be used for post-processing model output and making direct comparisons to ecological recommendations.


```
library(EvergladesEBM)

### map of recession rates over past two weeks
### function is highly flexible - see ?plotEDENChange for options
twoWeeks <- plotEDENChange(EDEN_date = Sys.Date(), 
           changePeriod = 2, # weeks
           addToPlot = sfwmd)
           
### recession/ascension during past month
pastMonth <- plotEDENChange(EDEN_date = Sys.Date(), 
           changePeriod = 4, # weeks
           addToPlot = sfwmd)

```
