### What is EverForecast?

EverForecast is a simulation tool developed by the Joint Ecosystem Modeling group, a collaboration between the United States Geological Survey and the National Park Service. EverForecast generates spatially-explicit estimates of the likely range of water levels across south Florida over the next six months. The implementation is described in detail by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104783">Pearlstine et al. (2020)</a>.
