Figure 2. Dry season high water threshold at gauge 3AS3W1 (inset map). Distribution of future water levels predicted by EverForeCast simulations (colored lines), along with observed water levels (black line). Horizontal line shows the dry season high water line (objective: stage <9.2 ft NGVD29 from April 15 to May 31).
